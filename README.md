# APITest    

# Description
This is Aaron Morefield's submission to the Services team at the EMBL-EBI organization. I apologize for its brevity and lateness: I am writing it on a second computer.

# Installation<
Git Pull from the master branch here at https://github.com/amore012/APITest
Run test.py in virtual environment from the commandline.
Service should be running on <a>127.0.0.1:5002, though only have a Windows machine to test this on it seems to run without hitch.
